## Update Overview

During this update phase, we mainly focus on Fine-Tuning LLMs(ChatGLM3) for Multi-Turn
Conversations. We've achieved the following milestones:

### 1. The overview of ChatGLM3
ChatGLM (Du et al., 2022) is an advanced language model leveraging autoregressive techniques for natural language understanding and generation. It uniquely incorporates an attention mask design that integrates both autoencoding and autoregression strategies. The autoencoding aspect involves randomly removing certain tokens from the input text, enabling the model to reconstruct missing elements based on the surrounding context. Conversely, autoregression sequentially reconstructs tokens, using both the corrupted text and previously predicted sequences as context, thereby enhancing the coherence of generated content. 

The third iteration of ChatGLM, known as ChatGLM3, marks a significant evolution from its predecessors by discarding the autoencoding component and fully embracing a decoder-only architecture. This version embeds input tokens into a high-dimensional vector space, employs rotational position embeddings for positional encoding, and utilizes multiple GLMBlocks. These blocks contain self-attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons for deep feature extraction and context understanding, with hierarchical normalization processes enhancing stability and performance. The output layer transforms the hidden state into a vocabulary-sized vector, facilitating efficient natural language generation.

ChatGLM3's vocabulary has been optimized to 65,024 entries, significantly reduced from the 150,528 of the prior model, which accelerates model loading times. The total parameter count of ChatGLM3 is approximately 6 billion, striking an optimal balance between computational performance and resource efficiency, making it particularly well-suited for local deployment. Additionally, this model has undergone pre-training on a large-scale bilingual corpus in both Chinese and English. This extensive and diverse training dataset, coupled with more comprehensive training steps and improved strategies, has enabled the model to master the linguistic patterns, grammatical structures, and vocabulary nuances of both languages, ideally supporting the bilingual nature of our project.

For fine-tuning in multi-turn conversation scenarios, ChatGLM3 includes the provision for spatial tokens, which can be manually integrated into model inputs. In our specific application, we have employed a "system" level prompt that configures the assistant's role as a mental health support counselor. By using distinct "user" and "assistant" tags, the fine-tuned model adeptly captures the dynamics of the conversation, making it particularly effective in multi-turn interactions within mental health support contexts. 

### 2. LoRA

#### 2.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

When training large language models (LLMs), which typically encompass billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters, the computational resources and storage requirements for full parameter fine-tuning are substantial. For instance, ChatGLM3-6B has approximately 6 billion parameters. Given the limited computational resources available in our project, performing full fine-tuning is impractical. Hence, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are particularly vital.

PEFT methods address this challenge by fine-tuning only a small subset of the model's parameters or adding a minimal number of additional parameters while keeping most of the pre-trained parameters fixed. This approach significantly reduces both computational and storage costs while achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning. Additionally, the training process becomes faster due to the reduced number of parameters needing adjustment, enabling more experiments and iterations within a limited timeframe. Consequently, PEFT facilitates efficient model optimization and performance enhancement under constrained resources.

#### 2.2 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)

- **Theory:**

    Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique designed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, thereby decreasing training time and GPU memory usage while maintaining the quality of model outputs. The core principle of LoRA involves adding additional network layers to the model and freezing the pre-trained model's weight parameters. Only the parameters of these additional layers are trained.

    LoRA is fundamentally an approximate value decomposition technique, performing low-rank decomposition of the feature matrices. Given the inherent low-rank nature of the model, the parameters of the additional network layers can be approximated using two low-rank matrices. These matrices have significantly fewer parameters compared to the original parameter matrices, thus greatly reducing the number of parameters that need to be fine-tuned.

### 3. Advantages of LoRA

Hu et al. (2021) conducted comprehensive experiments on the LoRA method, revealing several key advantages:

**3.1 Resource and Time Efficiency**


During the training process, LoRA requires fine-tuning only a small number of parameters within the low-rank matrices. This significantly reduces the resources and time necessary for training. Furthermore, the reduced number of trainable parameters results in lower memory usage, making it feasible to fine-tune models in resource-constrained environments.

**3.2 Comparable or Superior Performance**

Despite training only a minimal number of parameters, LoRA matches or even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning on several tasks. This is achieved by leveraging the low-rank approximation, which efficiently adapts the model to new data while preserving the essential characteristics learned during pre-training.

**3.3 Preservation of Pre-trained Model Performance**

LoRA maintains the performance of the original pre-trained model by adjusting only a subset of the parameters. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks without requiring a complete re-training, thus preserving the valuable knowledge encoded in the pre-trained parameters.
