## Update Overview

During this update phase, we mainly focus on Fine-Tuning LLMs(ChatGLM3) for Multi-Turn
Conversations. We've achieved the following milestones:

### 1. The overview of ChatGLM3
ChatGLM3 is a general language model based on autoregressive gap filling. ChatGLM3, adopts Transformer architecture, and contains about 6B parameters. Its core principle is to learn the grammar, semantics and contextual relationships of the language through unsupervised pre-training of a large amount of Chinese and English corpus. The design of ChatGLM3's custom attention mask is very clever: some tokens in the model are visible to each other, and Some tokens can only see part of the past tokens, but cannot see future tokens. This design utilizes the self-attention mechanism to achieve efficient context understanding and generation. The multi-head attention mechanism enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic information, allowing it to perform well in natural language processing tasks such as dialogue systems, text generation, and machine translation. The model is not only able to generate high-quality text, but also performs well in tasks such as dialogue and translation. Notable features of the third generation of ChatGLM include its parameter size of approximately 6B, which makes it a good balance between performance and resource consumption and suitable for local deployment. In addition, ChatGLM3 supports bilingual processing in Chinese and English, which perfectly meets the needs of our project. 

### 2. LoRA

#### 2.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

When training large language models (LLMs), which typically encompass billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters, the computational resources and storage requirements for full parameter fine-tuning are substantial. For instance, ChatGLM3-6B has approximately 6 billion parameters. Given the limited computational resources available in our project, performing full fine-tuning is impractical. Hence, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are particularly vital.

PEFT methods address this challenge by fine-tuning only a small subset of the model's parameters or adding a minimal number of additional parameters while keeping most of the pre-trained parameters fixed. This approach significantly reduces both computational and storage costs while achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning. Additionally, the training process becomes faster due to the reduced number of parameters needing adjustment, enabling more experiments and iterations within a limited timeframe. Consequently, PEFT facilitates efficient model optimization and performance enhancement under constrained resources.

#### 2.2 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)

- **Theory:**

    Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique designed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, thereby decreasing training time and GPU memory usage while maintaining the quality of model outputs. The core principle of LoRA involves adding additional network layers to the model and freezing the pre-trained model's weight parameters. Only the parameters of these additional layers are trained.

    LoRA is fundamentally an approximate value decomposition technique, performing low-rank decomposition of the feature matrices. Given the inherent low-rank nature of the model, the parameters of the additional network layers can be approximated using two low-rank matrices. These matrices have significantly fewer parameters compared to the original parameter matrices, thus greatly reducing the number of parameters that need to be fine-tuned.

### 3. Advantages of LoRA

Hu et al. (2021) conducted comprehensive experiments on the LoRA method, revealing several key advantages:

**3.1 Resource and Time Efficiency**


During the training process, LoRA requires fine-tuning only a small number of parameters within the low-rank matrices. This significantly reduces the resources and time necessary for training. Furthermore, the reduced number of trainable parameters results in lower memory usage, making it feasible to fine-tune models in resource-constrained environments.

**3.2 Comparable or Superior Performance**

Despite training only a minimal number of parameters, LoRA matches or even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning on several tasks. This is achieved by leveraging the low-rank approximation, which efficiently adapts the model to new data while preserving the essential characteristics learned during pre-training.

**3.3 Preservation of Pre-trained Model Performance**

LoRA maintains the performance of the original pre-trained model by adjusting only a subset of the parameters. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks without requiring a complete re-training, thus preserving the valuable knowledge encoded in the pre-trained parameters.
